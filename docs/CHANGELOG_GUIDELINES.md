# Changelog Guidelines

This document provides detailed guidance for maintaining changelogs in LightSpeed WP projects.

## Quick Start

### For Adding Entries

1. Open your project's CHANGELOG.md
2. Find the `[Unreleased]` section
3. Add your entry under the appropriate category:
   - **Added** — New features
   - **Changed** — Existing feature updates
   - **Fixed** — Bug fixes
   - **Removed** — Removed features
   - **Security** — Security fixes

4. Format: `- Description of change (#PR-number)`
5. Save and commit with your PR

### For Creating a Release

1. Determine new version using semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
2. Replace `[Unreleased]` with `[VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD`
3. Create new `[Unreleased]` section
4. Validate: `node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs CHANGELOG.md`
5. Commit and push

## Writing Good Changelog Entries

### ✅ Good Entries

```markdown
- Added async/await support for skill execution (#1089)
- Fixed memory leak in agent startup routine (#1092)
- Changed default timeout from 30s to 60s (#1091)
- Removed deprecated `sync()` method — use async instead (#1088)
- Security: Patched XSS vulnerability in template rendering (#1094)
```

### ❌ Bad Entries

```markdown
- Added stuff                          # ← No PR, too vague
- We fixed the memory leak             # ← First person, no PR
- Fix bug 8f3a2c1                      # ← Commit hash, not PR
- Added async support (but incomplete) # ← Draft in release version
- FIXED EVERYTHING                     # ← Wrong capitalization
```

### Rules for Writing Entries

1. **Start with verb**: Added, Fixed, Changed, Removed, Improved
2. **Use past tense**: "Added" not "Adding"
3. **Third person only**: "Fixed" not "We fixed"
4. **Be specific**: "Fixed memory leak" not "Fixed bug"
5. **Reference PR**: Always include `(#PR-number)` at end
6. **Keep it short**: Aim for 50-80 characters before PR reference
7. **Use em-dash for emphasis**: `— use this instead` not `- use this instead`

### Template

```markdown
- [Verb] [specific change] — [context if needed] (#PR-NUMBER)
```

## Semantic Versioning

### Version Bumps

| Bump | Change | Example | When |
|------|--------|---------|------|
| **MAJOR** | Breaking change | 1.0.0 → 2.0.0 | Removed/changed API |
| **MINOR** | New feature | 1.0.0 → 1.1.0 | New feature, backward compatible |
| **PATCH** | Bug fix | 1.0.0 → 1.0.1 | Bug fixes only |

### Examples

```
1.0.0 → 1.0.1: Fixed bug
1.0.0 → 1.1.0: Added new feature
1.0.0 → 2.0.0: Removed deprecated API (breaking)

```

### When to Bump

- **MAJOR**: When changes break existing code
  - Removed methods/APIs
  - Changed method signatures
  - Changed data formats
  - Changed configuration schema

- **MINOR**: When adding backward-compatible features
  - New methods/APIs
  - New configuration options
  - New capabilities

- **PATCH**: When fixing bugs
  - Fixes regressions
  - Improves performance
  - Clarifies documentation
  - Updates dependencies (usually)

## Common Issues

### Issue: Entry Too Long

**Problem:** Entry exceeds 100 characters

**Solution:** Shorten the description

```markdown
# Too long (118 chars)
- Support for async/await in skill execution with concurrent processing capabilities (#1089)

# Good (73 chars)
- Support for async/await and concurrent processing (#1089)
```

### Issue: Missing PR Reference

**Problem:** Entry has no PR/issue number

**Solution:** Add PR number at end

```markdown
# Bad
- Fixed memory leak

# Good
- Fixed memory leak (#1234)
```

### Issue: Wrong Tense or Person

**Problem:** Entry uses wrong tense or first person

**Solution:** Use third-person past tense

```markdown
# Bad
- We added async support
- Adding new features
- I fixed the bug

# Good
- Added async support
```

### Issue: Version Order Wrong

**Problem:** Versions are in wrong order

**Solution:** Put newest versions first

```markdown
# Bad
## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18
## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-30  ← Should be before 1.0.0

# Good
## [1.1.0] - 2026-10-30
## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-18
```

## Tools & Automation

### Validation Script

```bash
node scripts/validate-changelog.cjs CHANGELOG.md
```

Checks:
- Valid Markdown parsing
- Proper version format (semver)
- Date format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Presence of required sections

### CI/CD Integration

Changelog is validated automatically on:
- Pull request submission (strict checks)
- Pre-merge (format validation)
- Release creation (completeness check)

Failed validation will block merging.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I update a released version's changelog?**  
A: No, released versions are immutable. Create a new patch release if changes are needed.

**Q: Should I include the [Unreleased] section in commits?**  
A: Yes, keep [Unreleased] in the repo so future entries can be added during development.

**Q: Can I skip the PR number?**  
A: No, all entries must reference a PR/issue for traceability.

**Q: How do I document urgent hotfixes?**  
A: Add to [Unreleased], then release immediately as a PATCH version.

**Q: What if my change affects multiple categories?**  
A: Add entries to each category, or if tightly related, pick the primary one and note others in the description.

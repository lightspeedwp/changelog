# LightSpeed WP Changelog

A Claude Code skill for creating and reviewing WordPress project changelogs, with bundled sub-skills for branch context and changelog validation. The root [SKILL.md](SKILL.md) is the entrypoint.

## Install and invoke

Clone directly into your personal Claude Code skills directory:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lightspeedwp/ls-changelog.git ~/.claude/skills/ls-changelog
```

If this checkout already exists there, use it in place. In Claude Code:

```text
/ls-changelog Add changelog entries for this project's changes
/ls-changelog Review CHANGELOG.md for release readiness
/ls-changelog Map feature/gallery-controls to a changelog category
```

The parent skill reads the relevant sub-skill instructions when needed. The nested sub-skills are supporting files in this installation; they do not require separate installations or symlinks. This uses Claude Code's [personal skill entrypoint and linked supporting files](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills) (checked 1 November 2026).

## Helpers and current limits

Runtime use requires Node.js 18+ and no npm dependencies. Run helpers with the target project's changelog path explicitly:

```bash
node ~/.claude/skills/ls-changelog/sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/scripts/branch-context-mapper.cjs feature/gallery-controls
node ~/.claude/skills/ls-changelog/sub-skills/changelog-validator/scripts/validate-changelog.cjs /absolute/path/to/project/CHANGELOG.md --json
```

- [Branch Context Mapper](sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/SKILL.md) maps seven simple branch types to categories and version hints. It does not detect breaking changes or fully validate Git branch names.
- [Changelog Validator](sub-skills/changelog-validator/SKILL.md) checks for a changelog title and version-heading pattern. Its score, governance fields, and release-readiness flag are placeholders; manual review is required.

The skill instructions distinguish helper results from manual checks. Documentation and roadmap targets do not establish implemented enforcement. Changelog preparation alone does not authorise commits, tags, merges, or publication.

## Development checks

Each sub-skill has its own npm package and lockfile. There is no root npm package. Install development dependencies and run checks from each directory:

```bash
npm --prefix sub-skills/branch-context-mapper ci
npm --prefix sub-skills/changelog-validator ci
npm --prefix sub-skills/branch-context-mapper test
npm --prefix sub-skills/changelog-validator test
```

`npm test` runs ESLint, Prettier, Jest with a 90% coverage threshold, and BATS in sequence. Install BATS separately. A configured threshold is a requirement, not a claim that current tests achieve it. A failed earlier stage prevents later stages from running.

`lefthook.yaml` contains existing hook configuration; hooks are not installed by using the skill. Review that configuration before enabling it in a development checkout.

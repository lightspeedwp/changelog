# LightSpeed WP Changelog

Maintain the target project's changelog using Keep a Changelog structure and LightSpeed WP conventions. This repository is one Claude Code skill with two bundled sub-skills. Read their files as needed; they are supporting instructions, not separate slash commands in this installation.

## Choose the workflow

| Request                                                          | Read when needed                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Analyse a branch, choose a category, or recommend a version bump | [Branch Context Mapper](sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/SKILL.md)                 |
| Validate format, review governance, or assess release readiness  | [Changelog Validator](sub-skills/changelog-validator/SKILL.md)                     |
| Create or edit changelog entries                                 | [Changelog Guidelines](docs/CHANGELOG_GUIDELINES.md), then the validator sub-skill |

For a combined request, use the mapper to inform entries and the validator after editing. Load only the resources needed for the request. The guidelines describe the desired format; use the commands and implementation limits in the sub-skills for actual validation.

## Work in the target project

- Resolve the target repository and changelog from the user's request and current working directory. This skill's own `CHANGELOG.md` is not the default target when working in another project.
- Inspect the target project's instructions, existing format, relevant diff, commits, and PR information before writing entries. Preserve existing edits and released sections.
- Use `[Unreleased]` for development entries and the standard categories: Added, Changed, Deprecated, Removed, Fixed, Security. Describe user-visible changes with concise, specific wording and real PR or issue references. Do not invent references or release facts.
- Create a new changelog only when requested or needed for the task. Use `# Changelog` and `## [Unreleased]`; add dated version sections only when the version and release date are known.
- Recommend MAJOR for incompatible changes, MINOR for backwards-compatible features, and PATCH for backwards-compatible fixes. Treat branch names as hints; inspect the actual changes for breaking behaviour.
- When preparing an authorised release, move the relevant unreleased entries into `## [X.Y.Z] - YYYY-MM-DD`, retain an empty `[Unreleased]` heading, and preserve older releases. Follow the target project's version-file conventions.

## Bundled tools

Node.js 18+ is required to run the helpers. Both helpers use Node's standard library; runtime use does not require `npm install`.

Resolve helper paths from this skill directory and keep the working directory in the target project. Claude Code supplies `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` for this root entrypoint:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/sub-skills/branch-context-mapper/scripts/branch-context-mapper.cjs" 'feature/example-change'
node "${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/sub-skills/changelog-validator/scripts/validate-changelog.cjs" "/absolute/path/to/target/CHANGELOG.md" --json
```

When reading a sub-skill as a supporting file, resolve its relative links and script paths from that sub-skill's directory. Do not assume a second variable substitution or a separately installed sub-skill.

## Verify and report

Run the validator against the target changelog after editing. Its present implementation checks only the title and presence of a version heading; its fixed score, governance fields, and `readyForRelease` flag do not establish compliance or release readiness. Complete the requested review using the validator sub-skill's manual checks and available repository evidence.

Report changed entries, any version recommendation and its reason, checks actually run, and remaining gaps. Preparing a changelog does not by itself authorise committing, pushing, tagging, merging, or publishing a release.
